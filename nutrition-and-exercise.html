             <h2>Nutrition, Health and Exercise are my passion.</h2>


             <p>You are <strong>what you eat.</strong> I believe in the importance of consuming <strong>organic</strong> and <strong>nutrition-rich</strong> foods that are good for my body.</p>

             <p>The processed foods that are available in today's world are not what they used to be. With the growing population, foods are being pumped with unwanted <strong>hormones</strong>, <strong>GMO's</strong>, and other artificial substances in order to keep up with the demand.</p>

             <p>These sustances are harmful for our bodies and all the negative long-term effects they could have are not yet known by anyone. Because of this, it is important to <strong>stay healthy</strong> and eat as heathy as one can.</p>
