          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>I am 22-year-old senior year student at the <strong>Univeristy of Miami.</strong></p>

          <p>I was born in <strong>Mexico City</strong> and grew up in <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> and in Mexico.</p>

          <p>Thanks to these opportunities, I have been able to experience working with different people from many different backgrounds and <strong>cultures</strong>, which has helped me become a person that works well with <strong>diversity</strong> and that can handle change.</p>

             <h2>My Interests</h2>

             <p>I have many intertests outside of my field of study which also help shape the person I am today.</p>

             <p>Thanks to my background of moving countries at a young age, I am very interetsed in <strong>travel</strong> and discovering new cultures. I want to continue seeing the world througout my life as I truly feel it is something that enriches me and helps me <strong>grow</strong> in many ways.</p>

             <p>I also have a great interest in <strong>animals</strong>, especially dogs. I believe in putting my little grain of salt everyday in order to help protect the <strong>environment</strong> and therefore help animals stay safe and happy.</p>

             <p>Out of all my many interests, the one which I am most <strong>passionate</strong> about is <strong>health, nutrition</strong> and <strong>exercise.</strong> This is becasue my everyday life is filled with this and it has become a huge part of who I am. I love anything that involves fueling my body and mind with health becasue I know that being healthy is extremelly important in order to live a fufilling life. </p>

               <h2>Culver Experience</h2>
               <p>Culver Summer Schools and Camps is a <strong>military</strong> summer camp which I attended the summers of 2011 and 2012. This experience, to the day, is one of the most important and <strong>life-changing</strong> opportunities I have ever had.<p>

                <p>Culver reinstilled in me many important life and <strong>work ethic</strong> values which further helped shape me into the <strong>responsible</strong> and hard-wokrking person I am today.</p>

                <p>I can without a doubt say that this place had an extremelly positive impact on me, and beyond all the values and <storng>diciplines</strong> I learnt, I also made some of my best friendships there and I shared with these people amazing moments in a summer full of sports, sailing, military activities, learning, and more.</p>
